FIXES
Better name verification for bookmarks
- make the "new_bookmark" selection work better and allow that name


FUNCTIONALITY
Add a "Go" button which will navigate to the currently selected bookmark

Make a way to see a bookmark's URL (and get feedback about being on a bookmark's domain or exact url)


FUTURE
Add "auto mode", which will dynamically update a single bookmark
